# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Before I start my classes in a front-end web development bootcamp, I am required to complete a prework. As I was going through the different materials in the prework I realized there were a lot of things that I needed to remember and study. To be able to easily access the different sections and materials when I needed them, I decided to create a prework study guide webpage. 
The notes that I have added in the website helps me to remember the important points related to each topic. This study guide can be useful for future students of the bootcamp as well.
